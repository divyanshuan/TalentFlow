└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Data Flow Architecture**

1. **Initialization**: App loads → Check IndexedDB → Seed if empty → Render UI
2. **User Actions**: UI Event → API Service → IndexedDB Write → State Update → UI Re-render
3. **Data Persistence**: All changes immediately written to IndexedDB
4. **State Restoration**: On refresh, data loads from IndexedDB (no reseeding)

### **Component Architecture**

## 🔧 Technical Decisions & Rationale

### **1. Frontend Framework: React 19 + TypeScript**

**Decision**: Use React 19 with TypeScript for type safety and modern features.

**Rationale**:
- **Type Safety**: Prevents runtime errors and improves developer experience
- **Modern React**: Concurrent features, improved performance
- **Ecosystem**: Rich library ecosystem and community support
- **Maintainability**: Easier to refactor and scale

### **2. State Management: React Query + Local State**

**Decision**: React Query for server state, React hooks for local state.

**Rationale**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between server and local state
- **Caching**: Automatic background updates and caching
- **Optimistic Updates**: Better UX with immediate feedback
- **DevTools**: Excellent debugging capabilities

### **3. Local Persistence: IndexedDB via Dexie.js**

**Decision**: Use IndexedDB with Dexie.js wrapper for local data storage.

**Rationale**:
- **Assignment Requirement**: Must use local persistence
- **Performance**: Faster than localStorage for large datasets
- **Offline Support**: Works without internet connection
- **Structured Data**: Better than key-value storage for complex data
- **Dexie Benefits**: Promise-based API, transactions, indexing

### **4. Styling: Tailwind CSS**

**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.

**Rationale**:
- **Rapid Development**: Faster styling with utility classes
- **Consistency**: Design system built-in
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach
- **Performance**: Only used classes are included in build
- **Maintainability**: No CSS conflicts or specificity issues

### **5. Drag & Drop: @dnd-kit**

**Decision**: Use @dnd-kit for Kanban board drag and drop functionality.

**Rationale**:
- **Accessibility**: Built-in keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Performance**: Optimized for large lists
- **Flexibility**: Customizable behavior and styling
- **Modern**: Built for React 18+ with concurrent features

### **6. Form Handling: React Hook Form + Yup**

**Decision**: Use React Hook Form with Yup validation.

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: Minimal re-renders
- **Validation**: Schema-based validation with Yup
- **Developer Experience**: Simple API and good TypeScript support
- **Bundle Size**: Lightweight compared to Formik

### **7. Routing: React Router v7**

**Decision**: Use React Router for client-side routing.

**Rationale**:
- **SPA Requirements**: Single Page Application navigation
- **Nested Routes**: Complex routing structure support
- **History API**: Proper browser history management
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading capabilities

## 🐛 Issues Encountered & Solutions

### **1. SPA Routing on Netlify (404 on Refresh)**

**Issue**: Client-side routes return 404 when refreshed directly.

**Root Cause**: Netlify doesn't know how to handle client-side routes.

**Solution**:
```toml
# netlify.toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

**Files Added**:
- `public/_redirects`
- `netlify.toml`

### **2. Data Loss on Refresh (Reseeding Issue)**

**Issue**: App was clearing user data and reseeding on every refresh.

**Root Cause**: `seedDatabase()` was called on every app initialization.

**Solution**:
```typescript
export const seedDatabase = async () => {
  // Check if database already has data
  const existingJobs = await db.jobs.count();
  const existingCandidates = await db.candidates.count();
  
  // Only seed if database is empty
  if (existingJobs > 0 || existingCandidates > 0) {
    console.log("Database already has data, skipping seed");
    return;
  }
  // ... seed only if empty
};
```

### **3. React 19 + React Scripts Compatibility**

**Issue**: Import/export errors with React 19 and older React Scripts.

**Root Cause**: Version compatibility issues between React 19 and React Scripts 5.0.1.

**Solution**:
- Clean reinstall of node_modules
- Fresh package-lock.json
- Verified all imports work correctly

### **4. TypeScript Strict Mode Issues**

**Issue**: TypeScript errors with strict null checks and type assertions.

**Solution**:
- Added proper type guards
- Used optional chaining (`?.`)
- Implemented proper error boundaries
- Added null checks for API responses

### **5. IndexedDB Transaction Errors**

**Issue**: Race conditions when multiple operations tried to access IndexedDB simultaneously.

**Solution**:
```typescript
await db.transaction('rw', [db.jobs, db.candidates], async () => {
  // Atomic operations within transaction
});
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### **1. React Query Configuration**
```typescript
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
      retry: 1,
    },
  },
});
```

### **2. Component Memoization**
- Used `React.memo` for expensive components
- Implemented `useMemo` for computed values
- Used `useCallback` for event handlers

### **3. Lazy Loading**
- Code splitting with React.lazy
- Route-based lazy loading
- Dynamic imports for heavy components

### **4. IndexedDB Indexing**
```typescript
this.version(1).stores({
  jobs: "id, title, slug, status, order, createdAt, updatedAt",
  candidates: "id, name, email, stage, jobId, createdAt, updatedAt",
  // Proper indexing for fast queries
});
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### **1. Input Validation**
- Client-side validation with Yup schemas
- XSS prevention with proper escaping
- Input sanitization for user-generated content

### **2. Data Privacy**
- All data stored locally (IndexedDB)
- No external API calls
- No data transmission to third parties

### **3. Error Handling**
- Graceful error boundaries
- User-friendly error messages
- No sensitive information in console logs

## 📊 Testing Strategy

### **1. Manual Testing**
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Accessibility testing with screen readers

### **2. Data Integrity Testing**
- IndexedDB persistence verification
- State restoration testing
- Error handling validation

### **3. Performance Testing**
- Large dataset handling (1000+ candidates)
- Memory usage monitoring
- Bundle size optimization
